# BeatBugging

### OH NO, the system crashed, you open the logs, sits on your hacker's chair and now... IT'S TIME TO BEATBUGGING!!!

## Features

- **Interactive Console Game**: Debug logs through rhythm-based gameplay
- **Dynamic Music Generation**: Real-time beats that respond to log patterns
- **Musical Debugging**: Find errors and patterns through audio-visual cues
- **Various Waveforms**: Sine, square, sawtooth, and triangle waves for different log types
- **Adaptive Audio**: Music changes based on log severity and error patterns
- **Collaborative Design**: Music engine + CLI interface working in harmony

## Game Concept

**BeatBugging** combines the analytical process of log debugging with the engaging experience of rhythm games. Players navigate through system logs while the music engine generates beats and melodies that correspond to different types of errors, warnings, and system events.

**OUR GOAL**: The developer should feel like a hacker - you open the console, see your logs, now it's time to *beatbugging*.

- **Music Engine**: Converts log patterns into dynamic audio
- **CLI Interface**: Interactive console game mechanics
- **Together**: A unique debugging experience where finding bugs feels like playing music
